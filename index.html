This file contains the index html webpage for the drag and drop scrabble game. Currently there
are four wrappers that contain the various components of the game:
- game: Contains the game board, rack, and information about the game
- info: Contains the word, score, total score, and remaining tiles
- board: Contains the cells that represent the game board
- rack: Contains the tiles that the player can drag and drop onto the board

The game board is represented by cells that have different classes:
- Blank: blank
- Double Letter: double-letter
- Double Word: double-word

The rack is represented by tiles that have the letter of the tile as the id.

There are four buttons that the user can interact with:
- Submit Word: Submits the word on the board and calculates the score
- Mulligan Tiles: Refreshes the rack with new tiles
- Recall Tiles: Returns all tiles to the rack 
- Reset Game: Resets the game to the original state

The webpage imports jQuery and jQuery UI to handle the drag and drop functionality. The script.js file
contains the main logic for the game and the drag and drop functionality.
